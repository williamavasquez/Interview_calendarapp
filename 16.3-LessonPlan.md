# 16.3 Lesson Plan - **T**est **D**riven **D**evelopment

### Overview

This lesson will introduce students to the discipline of test driven development (TDD).

#### Instructor Priorities

* Students should be able to articulate the benefits of TDD and its relationship to design.

* Students should be know how to incorporate a TDD workflow into any development project.

* Students should be able to write focused tests.

#### Instructore Notes 

* If you haven't already, please review [project notes](../Project-Resources) readme before class today!

* Testing is as much a habit as an engineering discipline. As such, today's lesson largely consists of activities, such that students develop practical familiarity with the TDD workflow
 
* Bear in mind that student projects take priority. Feel free to omit activities or otherwise abbreviate the lesson plan if necessary. 

* Have your TAs refer to the [Time Tracker](16.3-TimeTracker.xlsx) to stay on task.

### Class Objectives 

* To develop familiarity with a test-driven workflow;

* To develop familiarity with testing tools; and

* To develop the habit of writing automated tests for application code.

### 1.	Instructor Do: Testing Workflows (0:10)	

* Emphasize that it's important to write tests as early as possible&mdash;and, preferably, before implementing any non-trivial functionality.

* Explain that the practice of writing tests for a feature *before* implementing the feature is called **test driven development**, or TDD.

* Emphasize that TDD affords numerous advantages, including:

  * Helping design a feature's API.

  * Providing persistent QA for any feature with a test, which helps guard against regressions.

  * Documentation of a feature's intended functionality and error handling.

* Point out that such a workflow, while ideal, can be time consuming, as manually running tests as often as TDD requires quickly becomes sluggish.

* Explain that there are tools which will automatically run your tests whenever you update any of your project's JavaScript.

* Explain that [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) is one such test runner. Have students install the following tools, briefly describing each in turn:

  * `npm i -g karma-cli`. The CLI allows you to initialize a Karma configuration file in any directory.

  * `npm i -D karma karma-chrome-launcher karma-commonjs karma-browserify browserify watchify mocha chai karma-mocha-reporter`

    * `karma-chrome-launcher` allows us to launch a test report in Chrome.

    * `karma-mocha` allows us to run our tests with Mocha.

    * `karma-browserify` allows us to use `browserify` and `watchify`. Explain that Browserify allows us to use Node's `require` in scripts we run in the browser.

    * Note that we need local installations of `mocha` and `chai` for our tests to run properly.

    * Finally, point out that `karma-mocha-reporter` prints test results to the command-line, just like Mocha.

  * Explain that Karma's configuration options go in a file called `karma.conf.js`. 

  * Explain how to create a new `karma.conf.js` with `karma init`. Have students run this command, and walk students through the following steps:

    * Tab to `mocha` for the testing framework.

    * Tab to `no` when prompted about RequireJS.

    * Select `Chrome` when prompted to capture browsers automatically. Don't add other browsers.

    * Add `src/*.js` and `test/*.js` as the locations for your source and test files.

    * Enter nothing when prompted about exclusions.

    * Select `yes` when prompted about Karma's watching files and running tests on change.

    * This creates a file called `karma.conf.js`. Open it, and guide students through the following changes.

      * Find the section that says `frameworks`. Add `'browserify'`.

      * Find the section that says `preprocessors`. Add a key that reads `'test/*.js'q, whose value is `['browserify']`.

      * Find the section that says `reporters`. Add `mocha` behind `progress`.

*Configuration options that need changing.*

* Save the file.

* In `test`, add a trivial test, such as the provided `test_sanity.js`.

*A trivial test to show what Karma´s default output should look like.*

* Run: `karma start`.

* Students should see a test report.

* Expect students to have issues with setup. Make sure your TAs are available to troubleshoot.

### 2.	Students Do: Test-Drive multiply (0:10)

* Once everyone is set up, slack out the following warm-up instructions to students.

  * **Instructions**:

    * Using your Karma setup, write tests for the `multiply` function we met in our last class. Make sure to test that it handles errors properly.

    * After you've written tests describing the behavior of `multiply`, open a terminal, and start Karma.

    * In another terminal, write your implementation for `multiply`. Notice that Karma executes your tests every time you change your implementation.

### 3.	Partners Do: Test-Drive PageUtilities (0:35)	

* Show the [solution to this exercise](Activities/1-Karma-Setup/Solutions), and ask if anyone needs clarifications. Answer any questions that come up, and slack out the solution file.

* Slack out the following instructions:

  * **Instructions**:

    * Write a class that can do the following:

      * Keep track of how many blog posts a blog maintains on each page.

      * Keep track of how many blog posts the blog contains.

      * Determine how many posts are on page number `n`. It should behave sensibly if the blog does not have a page `n`.

    * Before implementing any of this functionality, develop a test suite with your partner describing the desired behaviors. *Hint*: You'll have to come up with method names, too. Write some code that uses the object you're about to create. What seem like natural choices for the object and its methods' names?

### 4.	Instructor Do: Review Activity (0:10)

* Ask a group to describe the tests they wrote.

* Open the final test in [2-Page-Utilities/Solutions](Activities/2-Page-Utilities/Solutions). Explain why each test is present.


![Multiple clauses describing page-utilities.](Images/4-page-utilities-test.png)

*Multiple clauses describing page-utilities.*


* Open the final implementation of `PageUtilities` in [2-Page-Utilities/Solutions](Activities/2-Page-Utilities/Solutions). Briefly explain the implementation.

![The PageUtilities class itself.](Images/4-page-utilities.png)

*The PageUtilities class itself.*

* Slack out the above two files.


### 5.	BREAK (0:10)	


### 6.	Partners Do: Test-Drive format_name (0:35)

* Slack out the following instructions to students.

  * **Instructions**:

    * Your task is to write a function that accepts an array of names, and produces the following kinds of output:

      * For `['Pushkin']`: `Pushkin`.

      * For `['Pushkin', 'Gogol']`: `Pushkin & Gogol`.

      * For `['Pushkin', 'Gogol', 'Zamyatin']`: `Pushkin, Gogol & Zamyatin`.

    * With a partner, write unit tests against this behavior. Once you've described the function sufficiently, kick up a Karma server, and begin implementing the function.

    * Do your tests completely describe the function? Be ready to explain why, or why not.

### 7.	Instructor Do: Review Activity (0:10)	

* Open the solutions in [3-Format-Name/Solutions](Activities/3-Format-Name/Solutions).

* Open `test/format_name_test.js`. Explain why each `describe` clause is present.


![Tests for format_name.](Images/7-format-names-test.png)

*Tests for format_name.*


* Open `src/format_name.js`. Briefly explain the implementation.


![Implementation of format-name.](Images/7-format-names.png)

*Implementation of format_name.*


* Draw attention to the extra `else if` branches. Are they necessary?

* Kick up a Karma server. Eliminate the `else if` branches, and demonstrate that our tests still pass.

* Point out how valuable it is to be able to make such changes to our implementation, and be certain that it still works at least as well as before.

![Cleaner implementation of format_name.](Images/7-format-names-clean.png)

*Cleaner implementation of format_name.*


* Slack out the above two files.
